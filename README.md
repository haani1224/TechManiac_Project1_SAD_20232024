This repository is for Project 1 SAD 2023/2024
1.0 Introduction
KADA, under the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security, is focused on improving the socio-economic conditions of farmers in the Kemubu region. However, its current manual, paper-based system for cooperative membership and loan applications is inefficient, prone to data loss, and environmentally unfriendly. To overcome these issues, KADA plans to implement an all-digital platform for online applications, automated eligibility verification, and secure data management. This new system aims to enhance convenience, data security, and administrative efficiency, while also promoting environmental sustainability.
The project will proceed through several stages: planning to identify needs and feasibility, analysis to specify detailed requirements and review current processes, design to develop system architecture and security measures, development to build the platform and database, testing to ensure all features function properly, deployment to implement the system with minimal downtime, and maintenance for ongoing support and updates. The web-based, user-friendly, and secure system will be accessible only to KADA staff and current cooperative members, safeguarding sensitive financial processes.




2.0 Information Gathering
2.1 Method Used
On Industry Day, 15 May 2024, our team conducted an online meeting with Kelantan KADA Staff Cooperative Berhad to gather information for developing their online system. We discussed current processes, challenges, and specific needs with KADA Cooperative representatives, including the person in charge of credit union operations. Through detailed interviews, we explored the manual procedures for employee registration, loan applications, and monthly contributions, identifying key pain points and areas for improvement. Follow-up questions and clarifications via WhatsApp ensured comprehensive and accurate data collection. This information is crucial for creating a super app that will streamline and digitize Koperasi KADA's operations, enhancing efficiency and user-friendliness.
